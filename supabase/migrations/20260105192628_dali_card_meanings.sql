-- The Magician
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Personal magic. There is a kind of magic, which really works and is not limited to trickery, sleight of hand, hocus-pocus, or stage illusions. Magic, the »possibility of the impossible«, is nothing more — but nothing less — than becoming one with yourself, with God, and the world. The number of this card — One — cannot be divided by any other number. And the term »indivisible« has the same Latin root as »individual.« We are all artists and magicians. Dali portrays himself on the card as the »magus«, the magician, and displays paraphernalia from some of his best-known works on the table. We see Dali, but we realise that this card is really about you and me and our own individual talents and qualities. On your personal journey you go through unique experiences and come up with solutions that none other has thought of before. This sometimes appears to be a kind of wonderful magic. But your personal magic is not a supernatural thing. It is nothing but successfully creating your unique existence through your special talents and qualities. The flames on the picture symbolise the life force, the fire of creation and transmutation inherent in each of us. Bread and wine on the table symbolise the individual''s participation in the divine act of creation. The »soft« clock represents the elasticity and uniqueness of your personal time. The scroll on the table symbolises the making of plans, the designing of your own life. Like the pillars in the background all aspects of your personality should complement each other and unite in serving a higher purpose. In order to accomplish your task it is important to stay open (blue background), to go beyond your current limitations (the picture breaks through the upper frame), and to see your work within a larger context. Practical advice: No one can take your special talents and qualities away from you. Use your imagination, creativity, and communication skills. Do something extraordinary and unique.'

-- The High Priestess
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Inner knowing. Throughout human history we have often encountered the archetype of the High Priestess exemplified by oracles like Pythia of Delphi, by sibyls and prophetesses like Cassandra of Troy, and by many priestesses and nuns serving in temples and nunneries. Being a mirror this card counsels you that it is quite appropriate to seek guidance first and foremost within yourself. Many Tarot decks depict the High Priestess holding a holy book, which symbolises the ability to read the script of your own life. Dali wanted to express the same idea and gave her a scroll to hold. This card is all about your own role and your personal life style. It is about personal taste and style, and about expressing your own opinion. The blue background and the crescent moon symbolise the power of your soul, your inner voice, and your moods (changeable like the phases of the moon), which decide your fate. It is interesting how Dali depicts the clothing of the High Priestess. The outer garment (a kind of cloak) is reminiscent of a nun''s habit and is found on many portrayals of Mother Mary. But underneath her cloak the figure wears a black and blue sequined evening gown, which gives her a mundane and catlike look. The cat statue in the left hand corner emphasises this. The big head on the left side represents the unconscious mind feeding and tempting the soul with its long tongue. The High Priestess encourages you to develop the power of your own soul and your own inner knowing. Be headstrong. The rolled-up script of your life should be unrolled. Piety and frivolity, nun-like devotion and cat-like instincts are the two opposite poles, the extreme limits in which you have to master your feelings and moods. Practical advice: Listen. Become aware of sounds and the silence behind all sound — internally and externally. Create a space just for yourself. Train your voice and express what matters to you most.'

-- The Empress
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Your own true nature. The Empress represents the many empresses and queens of yesterday and today but also the Great Goddess of early history, the threefold Godhead of Christianity and other religions, the mother of gods like Isis and Mary, and last but not least the goddesses of love and fertility like Astarte, Aphrodite, and Venus. The card is a mirror of your own femininity (or of the female qualities in a man) reflecting your personal experiences as a woman and / or with women, the heritage of your mother, your grandmothers, and your foremothers. Gala Dali lent her face to represent the Empress. Much has been written about how much Gala dominated her Salvador. But this card goes way beyond any biographical anecdotes. The wide-open background allows the central figure — taken from a picture by Delacroix — to rule a vast realm and an ocean of possibilities. The imperial orb in her left hand symbolises fertility and the gilding of your own nature. Since the orb is a representation of the globe, it challenges you to claim this vast land as your own and to rule it. The lily sceptre in her right hand is an old symbol of fertility and virility. White stars dance around the head of the figure and help her rise above the blue water and the greyish mountains. This card is all about living a productive, blooming, and clearly defined life. Women as well as men are encouraged to be rulers of their own life and to take responsibility for their own well-being and fortune. Practical advice: In order to be happy and well it is important to create your own realm and establish rules (and follow them), which guarantee your well-being and joy. Take charge of your daily wellbeing. Kick false goddesses and foreign empresses out of your life!'

-- The Emperor
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Pioneer on one''s own behalf. Emperors and kings, gods like Zeus and Jupiter, as well as many other father figures have inspired this card. It is a mirror of your own masculinity (or of the male qualities in a woman) reflecting your personal experiences as a man and / or with men, the heritage of your father, your grandfathers and your forefathers. There is much to be gained if you interpret this card not only as a symbol of external (family or public) order, but also as a symbol of your power to rule your own destiny. The message of the Emperor should be heeded by men as well as women and encourages you to apply the art of self-rule and self-motivation. The lily sceptre in the left hand of the figure is a symbol of might and virility, of vital energy and fertility. But the picture shows a remarkable contrast. The colourful, magnificent and lively appearance of the figure in the foreground contrasts sharply with the desert and the black ruins in the background. The meaning? Your greatest talents will come to nothing, if they are used destructively or if you don''t succeed in building something new out of the ruins of the old. Turn your desert into a garden! Every one of us brings something new into the world, which needs to be explored and developed. The Emperor represents the pioneering spirit in all of us and the force, which opens up new possibilities in life or love. Dali shares this interpretation with many other versions of the Emperor. What is different is the unique position of the right hand. This gesture can be interpreted as indecisiveness, or weakness. But by the same token it can suggest a playful and coquettish teasing. In short: Dali portrays the Emperor as a multi-sexual playboy. This image is emphasised by the two little birds. (Symbols of spirit, eros, willpower, and imagination.) Practical advice: Put your pioneering spirit to use. Explore your current situation. Don''t imitate, innovate! Create your own facts. You are the master of your game.'

-- The Hierophant
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Personal essence. All High Priests of many different religious traditions have one thing in common: It was — and is — their foremost task to interpret the mysteries of life and to organise the appropriate rites. It is your task today to recognise this power within yourself. The key is right in front of your very eyes. The staff with the triple cross hints at the Christian pope. In a much broader sense it is a symbol of connecting to something larger, of the passage between heaven and earth. The staff is like an antenna, which enables you to receive and send messages from and to near and far places. The whole person is needed. The big figure and the two smaller ones are metaphors for your personal strengths and weaknesses. Utilise both and take that into consideration, which goes beyond your current understanding. The circles and rays around the figure''s head symbolise a higher consciousness, which transcends your own personality. For religious minded people this card suggests finding your way to God and making your peace with Him. In a broader sense this card is all about teaching and learning, initiating and understanding. In order to know others you have to know yourself and the purpose of your own existence. What is so special about Dali''s interpretation is that it focuses on the mutual initiation and communication processes going on between people (or between different aspects of your own personality). Aside from the three figures there is no church and no hint of religious dogma to be seen. But the halo around the head emphasises the presence of a greater dimension. Dali shows that the sacred manifests itself in our daily human interaction. Each person is a spiritual teacher for every other person if it can manifest the sacred. Practical advice: Initiate others into your mysteries. Open yourself to the needs of others. That which makes sense stimulates the senses.'

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Paradise and the shadow. Many of us remember the story of man''s expulsion from paradise, as it is told in the Bible and many other traditions. Less well known — but still a part of our Occidental tradition — is the story of man''s return to paradise, of the eternal life beginning after the Day of Judgement. Well, your day of judgement is today! We long for love, but we are also afraid to love and be loved. Whether or not love makes us happy depends on our views on love. As long as you are looking for your »better half«, you risk being only half a person. If you are looking for the one who is exactly like yourself, you should seriously consider whether this is what you really want. If you are looking for the one person who is like yourself in every aspect, who intimately knows and understands you, you are in reality looking for yourself. The more pronounced the differences are, the more precious the points of harmony. Once you have learned to love the differences, the doors to a new paradise will open. But be careful. Many shadows and dark clouds will obscure the way. Only love based on the individuality and originality of each partner will reach the new paradise and find its highest point in inspiring experiences, which go beyond the reach of each individual. (See the angel above.) Practical advice: The little angel in the picture also represents the child of the two lovers. This might hint at a real child or could be understood in a figurative sense. Every kind of relationship — even the one with yourself or with a business partner — needs a »child« in the figurative sense: a brainchild, a productive result or outcome, a living testimony of your partnership and cooperation that lives and grows.'

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Mindfulness. It is but a small step from the right attitude of the Chariot to Justice, which is not concerned with abstract principles, but tries to answer the age-old question: How do we manage to do that, which is right for us and how do we abstain from that, which is not right for us? The land on the card represents familiar territory and the water, the uncharted territories beyond. In order to wisely judge you have to connect the known with the unknown — and learn to distinguish one from the other. The scales of justice measure that which is only vaguely known. Unclear feelings, thoughts, and physical sensations have to be evaluated, prejudices have to be overcome. Dali painted the woman in the well-known style of Lukas Cranach. Her wild mane represents an abundance of life force, but also the invincible spirit of justice. Her girl like body hints at two kinds of virginity. (Which already refers to the card The Hermit.) Some people consider virginity and innocence virtues that are forever lost with the first sexual encounter. Other people see virginity and innocence as goals of personal growth that we have to work towards. »Innocence is nothing that can be lost, it is something that can be gained.« (Bertolt Brecht) This kind of virginity and innocence is exemplified by mindfulness and the ability to get involved without getting entangled. Practical advice: The more precise the investigation, the more loving the judgement! »The more knowledge is contained within a thing, the greater the love.« (Paracelsus) What is currently needed is the courage to criticise and to praise, especially the willingness to shed the discerning light of love on every person and event, on both the high and the low points of your life.'

Luca Pacioli, born around 1445, was one of the most outstanding personalities of the Renaissance. In 1475 he became a lecturer at the University of Perugia, Italy. In 1494, after receiving his ordination as a Franciscan monk, he wrote his epochal work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita, a summary of the entire mathematical knowledge of the time. One of the chapters titled Particularis de Computis et Scripturis made him especially famous, because it was the first comprehensive treatise on doubleentry accounting, also known as the Venetian method. During the seven years he worked at the court of the Sforza family in Milan, he taught Leonardo da Vinci perspective and proportionality. This resulted in two of da Vinci''s immortal works: the illustrations in Pacioli''s book De Divina Proportione and the mural The Last Supper at the Dominican monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie.'

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Great resolution. Your individual life as well as the universal life will be enriched if you cooperate with your own destiny. Your ordinary life will be twice as meaningful. »You only live twice!« Do not exhaust your energy by simply trying to survive. Your life is meant to be much more than plain day-to-day survival or a heroic fight for survival. The picture shows the zodiac that reminds us of a witch board. Outside the circle you see five figures that represent a variation of well-known depictions of the four evangelists and the four elements fire, water, air, and earth. On top of the circle an Oriental man with a scimitar can be seen. The disc in the middle is divided into two parts, symbolising human consciousness and unconsciousness. Both parts complement each other, but they also differ from one another. The lower part is full of symbols and signs, while the upper part is empty. This might refer to the fact that the messages of the unconscious are only conveyed through symbols. The Greek word »symbol« in a general sense means, »that which has been thrown together.« This hints at an important aspect of this card: The wholeness of the self or individual completeness can only be achieved by uniting consciousness and unconsciousness. If the individual is reconciled with his destiny, he will be in harmony with the world and experience synchronicity and resonance. Practical advice: You learn to work in harmony with your destiny by lovingly — and critically — accepting »chance« and correlations that go beyond your current understanding. Because Tarot allows you to work with chance, it constitutes an ideal training ground. For the next ten days draw a card every day.'

-- Strength
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'The art of loving. This card is all about deliberately dealing with vital energy and lust. It teaches you to love all of creation. The flowers on the card may be the flowers of love, but could also be Baudelaire''s »flowers of evil.« Dali''s signature integrates the swastika, an ancient Indo-Arian symbol of the sun and of life that the German Nazis misused as their symbol of death and destruction. The beast-like creature on the left is a special work of art. From afar it resembles a toad, but under closer scrutiny you see the body of a lion and the teeth of a fighting dog. One might rightfully assume that all three aspects — toad, lion, and dog — play an important role. They are all creatures that long to be released from a curse like the bewitched prince in many fairy tales. This creature represents the base instincts that sometimes need to be accepted and at other times overcome. The key to discovering your own strength is a loving and determined handling of your id. (The libido, instinct, energy) The woman and the animal hint at the archetypical story of »Beauty and the Beast.« If the one is released from its curse, the other gains its freedom too. This card is not just about strength, power, and lust, but it also stands for the cultivation of your personality, which will enable you to minimise harmful influences on your life and which allows your own creative forces to blossom. If you succeed you will be able to grow beyond the boundaries of your ego and you will understand much better, where you have to draw the line. Practical advice: Beware of useless ideals and of violence in the name of love. Give your lust for life another chance. Living fully means always being totally present. This is the card of the high points and peak experiences in sexuality as well as in all other aspects of life.'

-- The Hanged Man
UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Passion. At a first glance the upside-down position of the Hanged Man appears to be pretty strange. No wonder that strangeness, rapture, and the absurd are all elements of this card. But there is another important element. The Hanged Man has a clearly defined worldview, but his point of reference is not worldly, it is transcendental. This might be interpreted in a religious sense, but also in another sense that could be summarised in the phrase »man''s will is his heaven.« At the same time the picture could be viewed as an underwater world, a land of dreams, or an otherworld, in which the Hanged Man is immersed. Saint Francis'' motto was »Metanoeite«, which can be translated as »Turn around and change.« His symbol is the T-cross. Saul turned into Paul. Stories about shamans, sorcerers like Merlin, or gods like Odin abound, who all had to undergo severe trials, during which everything was turned upside down. On the other hand the picture hints at an inappropriate passivity and at a person, who simply »hangs loose.« In one way or another one has reached the end of the rope. This card indicates a passion, which could either be defined as great suffering or as uplifting enthusiasm. The Hanged Man believes in what he hangs on to. And he hangs on to that, in which he believes. It is important to reevaluate your own belief system, which often includes turning everything upside down and completely changing your own point of view. Practical advice: Reevaluate your beliefs and presumptions. If you have found your belief system to be true, do not hesitate to surrender to it completely. A meaningful belief and deliberate passion are the greatest of all emotions.'

Sitting in front of a cypress tree he began crushing the letters in his hands until they turned into a kind of paste. The resulting balls looked very much like the seeds of a cypress tree. Dali put them on the tree where the seeds originally had been.

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'True will. This card is different from all the others. The colours are pale. It creates a somewhat overexposed impression. It looks more like a sketch then a finished painting. It also seems to be less artful than the others. All these attributes have given rise to many speculations. Rachel Pollack called it a »crude comic«; while others consider it a rather awkward homage to Dali''s lady friend Amanda Lear, and still others simply suspect that Dali didn''t know what to do with a card called Temperance. In the upper left corner we see some letters painted over in blue. But they do not explain the true meaning of the card either. Maybe the card is just a mistake or a failure, or the meaning of the card can only be discovered in a different realm altogether. Even in ancient Greece, long before the first Tarot cards were created, temperance was considered to be one of the cardinal virtues. Temperance has to do with the right measure and with human creativity. You will not find your own true measure, your own art of living, by looking towards idols and masters. What seems to be a foundling among Dali''s Tarot cards is really a provocation of the viewer''s intuition. All idols pale beside your own creative process and turn into sketches or rough drafts. The card counsels you to become active and to design your own life as an artist and a master of the art of life. Traditionally Temperance is considered to be a fire card. The fire cleanses you of all impurities and gives birth to your true will. Your true will can only be discovered by giving up the position of commentator and spectator and becoming an active participant in life. Practical advice: Existing facts may be melted down and newly forged. Joyfully change the world and begin to play with new possibilities and results. Create your own »creativity workshop.« Find a place where you can spend time alone on a regular basis.'

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Working with the taboo. The card shows a hermaphroditical figure with a wild mane, one horn on the head and one on the knee, a wand or a flute in its hand, bouncing off some kind of pedestal. Two black arms release the figure or try to grab it. At a first glance this card appears strange, but it has the advantage of avoiding a stereotypical portrayal of the devil. This enables us to ask, »What meaning does the devil have for us today?« Each and every human being brings something new into the world, but we all have certain qualities and peculiarities that do not fit into the present framework. Every human being continues the story of creation — and therefore touches that which is considered taboo. When the Devil card is turned over, it is a clear indication that some kind of taboo has been violated. What was hidden before now becomes visible. This can be used to your advantage because you can now openly deal with it and create or reaffirm meaningful taboos and do away with others that no longer make sense. Don''t be scared by this card. This is your chance to get rid of some old fears. On the one hand the Devil represents a vampire and a burden that makes your own life and that of others unnecessarily difficult. This is what you are afraid of and now — that you have recognised it for what it is — you can let go of it. On the other hand the Devil represents the »prodigal son«, that part of you that you have always denied and neglected although you secretly and rightfully long for it. Now is the time to bring the prodigal son home. Practical advice: Once you have shed light onto the darkness, the vampire will turn to dust and the prodigal son will gain shape and colour. Dare to face the unknown and observe it closely until you can decide what parts of it to use and what to discard.'

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Encounter with the absolute. Two archetypes determine the meaning of this card: the tower of Babel and the Pentecost. The building of the tower of Babel is a symbol for human megalomania, which ends not only in the destruction of the tower but also in the confusion of tongues of the Babylonians. The Pentecost on the other hand is the opposite of the building of the tower. The Holy Ghost descends onto the disciples in tongues of storm and fire. As they start to talk, everyone hears them in their own language. Instead of a confusion of tongues this event symbolises a tearing down of all language barriers. Babel and the Pentecost are the two opposite poles of the use of the highest energies that are available to man. They represent two totally different kinds of being beside oneself. Violence destroys and results in speechlessness and confusion. Love tears down all language barriers and makes true communication possible. The card cautions you to beware of megalomania and a lack of steadfastness. There might be rocky times ahead. You are gently — but persistently — urged to leave your ivory tower and your personal objections and pretences behind when the right time has come. »Riders on the storm.« This card also represents jumping out of the clouds and turning the free fall into flying. Practical advice: Go ahead and give it your all! You will gain more love and protect yourself better from danger if you learn to consciously deal with your high-strung energy. Risk being more direct! Jumping out of the clouds also stands for the joy it brings when you totally commit yourself ~ even though or just because you have no way of knowing whether or not you will land on safe ground.'

You only have to find it and, as the figure on the card shows, take it into your own hands and hold it up high, i.e. honour and appreciate it, be aware of it. Once the star lightens up your day as well as your night, then the truth will be revealed in all its beauty. Sometimes the card warns you of inappropriate brazenness or exposure. The great blue serpent in the sky represents the wonders of creation that you participate in. But the card also warns you to be aware of the pitfalls of the star, namely the star-cult. Be careful not to use your own light to put others in the shade. Be equally careful not to neglect your own light by admiring other distant stars too much. Generally speaking jugs and cups represent emotional needs, desires, and fears. In this sense the figure holds her emotional needs in her hands. You carry the vessel that you are! An old idea claims that man as a whole is but a vessel in the hands of God — a vessel, which is filled and emptied out during the course of a lifetime. This vessel symbolises the individual''s part in the great stream of life. Practical advice: »Each life follows its own star.« (Hermann Hesse) Reveal yourself, do your part. Do not hide your own beauty and your truth. Share it with others; give generously because you have more than enough of it. Do not hide your light under a bushel.

But the card is portrayed in darker tones and that for a good reason. Not only this version, but also most versions of this card show twins, mostly children, which discretely hints at a second birth. The second birth is a metaphor, which means that you as an adult have to give birth to yourself. Your first birth brought you into this world. Your second birth is nothing less than deliberately choosing your own life''s path. This path is not defined by habitual behaviour and fixed routines; it is created of your own free choosing and by exercising your own free will. Traditional behaviour and thought patterns have to be replaced by a consciously chosen life style. (The second birth may be followed by a third or even a fourth birth, because in reality it is a daily rebirth. But the second birth is the most important one, because it is the first birth of consciousness.) This »place in the sun« is the theme of most romantic novels and films, but also the Buddhist goal of enlightenment or the Christian maxim »If you do not become like the little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.« But this second birth is only the result of a process of becoming. As long as you are lacking a true understanding of yourself, which can only be gained by understanding your place in the world, you will remain in an in-between state, in a period of »being on the road.« Because this road is full of difficulties, the colours of the picture are subdued and somewhat dark. This card is not about lazily basking in the sun, this card is about finding your way towards the sun, which is located in the very centre of yourself. Practical advice: Beware of all delusions.

The angel is sounding the trumpet, the graves are opening up, and the dead are brought back to life. In the foreground we see an open shell sketched in black ink, which presents its pearl. This detail represents the message of the whole card. You are subjected to the influence of strong energies and you possess strong energy. Latent energies are being awakened and call on you to change and transform yourself. This card challenges you to take a closer look at and to deal with the extreme aspects of your life. Major desires and fears as well as the habit of putting the blame on yourself and others will have to be dealt with over and over again, until the basement of your past is cleaned out and the penthouse of your future is fully furnished. Only then will rebirth be more than a repetition of the old. It will truly be a new beginning on a higher level. The story of Judgement Day is not just a religious myth, it is to be taken literally. The Day of Judgement is today! Each and every morning we are faced with the task of awakening and accepting all of our energies. That includes really burying all that which is dead and preparing yourself for the birth of that, which has not been born yet. Every day is a farewell and a new beginning. If you can accept every single day as a gift, you will gain faith and an active interest in life. There will always be desires and fears, but you will have learnt to handle them appropriately. You will open up towards the colourful spectacle that is life, which is beckoning you to participate. Practical advice: Let go of that, which has been. Say your goodbyes and make your peace with it.

UPDATE tarot_cards
SET meaning_upright = 'Resolution of contradictions. This card refers to the content of the Chariot. (In the middle of the central figure of that card we recognise a frame, reminding us of the cage on this card.) But the World also refers to the content of The Devil. The vampire or the nuisance and the prodigal son, who both represent the taboos symbolised by the Devil card, can be recognised in the big black creature, which is imprisoned and seems to be weeping. This card seems to convey the pessimistic message that evil always puts the righteous in chains and will eventually triumph. But this is just another verse in the age-old song of worldly weariness. We prefer the interpretation that the three graces — and with them faith, love, and hope — will help the world to advance. On their long leashes they pull up this dark and fiery creature from the very centre of the earth. Thus Goethe''s Faust ends with the well-known sentence: »The indescribable, it is done. The eternally feminine always lifts us up.« Humanity has not just descended from heaven to earth, but also from the treetops to the ground. (Angels and apes are both our ancestors.) On every level of our evolution we are called upon to deal with our heritage, our source of being. Although we often discover dangerous traits in ourselves and others, we always also discover new, hitherto unknown areas of growth.

(Wands) This is especially true of the figure depicted on this card, which portrays the French queen Marie Antoinette. (From a painting by Marie Louise Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun.) If you draw this card, it indicates that your current questions require a confident handling of all forces of fire. Your mastery as an energetic being is called for, not just the mastery of one single aspect of your will. Many versions of this card show a cat, but Dali uses a tail-wagging dog running towards the queen. Play, movement, and hunting instinct are just as important for the Queen of Wands as living in and with nature. The tree and the sketchily drawn birds sitting on its branches emphasise this. But the tree and the dog are placed outside of her frame of life. Below her and behind her something is going on. Because instinct, action, and will (the force of growth represented by the wands suit) are of utmost importance for this card, the success of your actions depends upon recognising the existence of subliminal (the dog) and unconscious (the tree) processes. The Queen of Wands is the mistress of basic instincts, which include sexuality, self-preservation, and reproduction. If she handles them well, she gains the miraculous power of trusting her creative abilities even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. She creates new life out of nothing. Practical advice: Rely on your ability to take charge at the right moment and to get things moving. In order to understand that enemies and obstacles are nothing but challenges and new chances, you might have to change your way of thinking. Recognise your abilities and decide upon your own goals.'

It is however not so unusual for another card that is intimately linked with the King of Wands. It has been a long tradition to portray a child on card XIX, The Sun. The meaning of this symbol is not quite as innocent as one might assume. As an adult you have to become a child again in order to confidently handle your fire. (Instinct, action, and will) The giant wand represents a phallus as well as a witches'' broom. It is a symbol of motivating power, growth, and aliveness as well as of strength and authority. Underneath the throne we see a small animal. Perhaps it is a salamander, which is known to be able to walk through fire without being harmed. But it could also be a furry animal (an ermine), a rodent. The salamander symbolises the death and rebirth of the human will. It stands for ordeals of fire and personal purification. The rodent warns you to beware of nagging doubts, which will only weaken your roots. But the fur of the ermine could also indicate royal dignity. Like in many other Tarot decks the back of the throne is emphasised in this one too. It looks like a mighty red flame surrounded by a blue silhouette, indicating coolness or stiffness. On the left of it we see a sketchily drawn face in profile, which looks amused as well as stern. In short: Man''s will is his heaven. As a child we are usually totally uninhibited. But once we grow up we lose the contact with the world of the child and are often haunted by nagging doubts. Or we refuse to grow up and are suddenly and unexpectedly forced to recognise our true power. Practical advice: Recognise your tasks and necessities as what they really are: chances. Be willing to walk through the fire to fulfil your heart''s desire. Do it skilfully and without fear.'

A blue toad adorned with stars or diamonds sits underneath the horse. All these symbols have one common denominator: »Become who you are!« This is the card of your life''s purpose. We begin our journey small — just like the horse and rider. We are more an outline than a finished picture. The details have to be filled in and coloured in. Our aim in life and our potential is self-realisation and the full development of our personality. The red and purple lines symbolise this huge task. The gigantic wand hints at strong instincts and at a steady supply of energy. Our life''s tasks are the best and greatest tasks that we will be faced with. They require and focus all our strengths and take a lifetime to be resolved. Often on this journey high ideals and toad-like instincts have to be overcome. If you possess a lot of fire, you are not only very courageous, but often also extremely tired, shy, or irritable, because you have been burned too often. »The burnt child dreads the fire.« The blue and jewelled toad functions as a point of reference in two ways: It represents something to get away from (something unpleasant) or (even if you are not aware of it now) something to attain. (Something valuable.) Practical advice: You possess an incredible amount of energy. Bring light into the dark. Help those who are weaker than you. Commit yourself to meaningful projects that will benefit many people. Where the darkness is greatest, your light is most needed. It is here that you will discover your life''s purpose.

At the same time the card warns you to be aware of your limited perception, because you are so immersed in your own concerns. The snake-like or butterfly-like drawings around the central figure symbolise however, that your potential is much larger. Your zest for action and your joy in growing challenge you to grow beyond yourself now. Compared to your motivational forces (wands, fire energy) your actual experience is relatively small. This is a danger, but also a chance. Beware of naive inactivity as well as of naive zeal. You came into this life full of the will to survive, to grow, and to express yourself. Use this will now to explore your world and to welcome each success or failure as a new experience. If you welcome ordeals of fire and recognise them as an inner purification, you will grow old in years and experience, but you will remain young at heart and mind.

Human beings possess basic instincts such as self-preservation and reproduction as well as »cultural instincts« such as love and aggression. The symbol of the hands on this and other cards of the wands suit hint at the fact that our instincts determine our behaviour and actions. Only if we are in constant contact with our inner fire, will we succeed in all our endeavours. But sometimes we fail. We need to go through many ordeals of fire and sometimes we have to burn up in order to be born again — like the mythical bird phoenix. This is symbolised by the sickle in the upper right hand corner and the flower. The positive result of all such transformational processes is a cleansing and purification of our instinct and behaviour. Therefore wands and the fire element in general are symbols of the human will. If all goes well, we will discover our true will. As it goes in the old Rolling Stones song, »You can''t always get what you want, but if you try sometime, you just might find you get what you need.« This card is all about finding your true identity and your place in the world. To be centred within yourself and to be at home in the world often presents you with two conflicting issues or the two ends of a wand that need to be reconciled. Practical advice: This card challenges you to do something (active) or to let something happen. (Passive) You will find the answer or resolution in doing. Follow your energy and keep moving.

This conflict might pertain to short-term interests and intentions or to major conflicts in life. The former might relate to having to accomplish two different things at the same time. The latter could pertain to loving two people simultaneously or to the conflict between family and career. The message of this card is: There is always a solution! It is possible to master even the greatest of conflicts. And: Sometimes rudeness can only be answered with rudeness. Turn emotional conflicts into practical tasks and find the solution that fits the problem. This solution always has to do with an alchemistical transformation of the coarse into the subtle. Divide the seemingly huge conflict into smaller portions that are easier to deal with. This approach is much more useful than staring at the snake like the proverbial rabbit (see the green something at the foot of the figure) or making bad compromises. The model of a castle that the woman is carrying on a silver platter or a mirror represents that you need a vision of the future and of your own goals in life. And you need to be willing to go through the fires of hell to achieve your goals. The bird on the right could be a cock, the symbol of alertness and of pride. If you use your imagination you might recognise a phoenix, the bird of fire. The phoenix has to burn up periodically to be reborn from the ashes and regain his beauty. Dali emphasises the beauty aspect of this card, not the martial aspect. Practical advice: Great tasks lie before you. Do not allow yourself to be pushed into a corner. You will only succeed if your will and your enthusiasm are unbroken. Rely on your own strength. Have confidence in your determination and your self-discipline.

The female silhouette does not represent a special woman, but women in general, the mother archetype, or the feminine principle. Many philosophers have described the ocean as the »eternally feminine«, the source and aim of all our striving. The female silhouette and the ship could hint at opposing desires. On the one hand the longing for remoteness, on the other the longing for closeness. Home and abroad, arriving and leaving, staying put and roaming around are the two poles. In order to devotedly, patiently, and serenely (symbolised by the shadowy woman and the ocean) unite your instincts and your actions (symbolised by wands and ship) in such a way that one does not take precedence over the other, you need a lot of practical experience and will have to undergo some personal metamorphoses. (Symbolised by the butterflies.) What''s so special about the Dali picture is that it puts the woman and the ship into the same context. Even the greatest of undertakings have small motives, which can often be found in personal relationships. The contact with someone close gives us the energy and the fuel to go forth into the farthest corners of the earth. Practical advice: Let go of any half-heartedness. If you put all your effort and all your power into something, you will succeed. Become clear what it is that you want to achieve and which personal and emotional needs are related to your most important goals.

One might assume that it is God''s will that we dance, sing, and be merry. But also that our human merriments are small and go around in circles unless we take the higher dimension of our being into consideration. In many cultural traditions the blue flower represents the mysteries of life and the wonders of creation. The term »wonders of creation« pertains to our most intimate, our most difficult, and most beautiful experiences. Birth, marriage, and death (which are represented by the three figures) always take us to the very limits of our understanding. Because we are confronted with these sometimes frightening, sometimes wonderful, but always amazing limits of our understanding, we develop a hunger for culture. We yearn to express that which really moves us through play, music, and dance. All truly creative endeavours are born out of experiencing our limits. Parties and cultural events may either inspire us or divert us in such a way that we hardly know ourselves any more. This card is all about discovering what really moves you and to deepen your understanding of yourself as you climb up the ladder of life. Practical advice: Avoid petty solutions and bad compromises.

This process is depicted on the card. In the background we see seven or eight helmets of lance-bearers and twelve lances. Each one of the twelve lances and of the five green wands represents a certain type of energy. Just like in an over-sized game of spillikins it is your task to pick up this energy, to sort through it, and to focus it on something worthwhile. Different interests and tendencies — between people as well as within one person — are always in conflict. What has first priority? How can several goals be attained at the same time? It is an integral part of this process to wipe out existing role models like you would wipe out a chalk painting on a blackboard. That is the meaning of the red mess in the middle of the card. Your personal fire, your power, and your aliveness create new facts. You act and decide without following old role models because your current actions and decisions go way beyond traditional experiences. Do not scatter your energy. Centre yourself. See your current tasks as tests of your determination, your willpower, and your playfulness. Find out which aspects of your will are in harmony with your desires. Only these will be able to get something moving. Find out which acts of will are unnecessary, because they are trying to force something, which is no longer relevant or has not become relevant yet.

This small figure represents man''s proverbial »second childhood«, or the inner child. Because he is drawn only vaguely and has no face, we might rightfully assume that this aspect of the rider is underdeveloped. Unless you accept your inner child, you are bound to be driven by childish motives and fears — without even being aware of it. Unless you integrate it, you will have only part of your power at your disposal. (Only one of six wands.) We often think that we have to suppress our weaknesses in order to become proud and strong. The picture shows us that in reality the opposite is true. If you acknowledge strengths as well as weaknesses, you will become much stronger. (See the horse and the energy of the five additional wands.) The five wands represent influences and events that are beyond your control. If you know your strengths as well as your weaknesses you will become much more flexible. Thus you enhance your ability to cooperate with your destiny. You need to reconcile yourself with your inner child and with your own animalistic aspects. You need to make peace with your own imperfections and say good-bye to many immature behaviours and habits. This process of growing up is represented by the ring and the one wand, which symbolise the differences between as well as the unification of the feminine and the masculine. A mature sexuality enhances your personal power and vitalises your self-confidence. It is important to recognise the feminine and the masculine as two aspects of your own personality.

Hands and arms symbolise what and how we move things and how we handle them. This card indicates openness and reserve, the inside as well as the outside of our actions. The fingerless hand and the swollen hand indicate our handicaps. (The first and second hand from the top.) Because arms and wands lie across our life''s journey they indicate that we do not have to accept what is being handed to us. On the one hand we are being encouraged to march to the sound of our own tune, on the other we are warned not to put up any unnecessary resistance towards life. The thin blue figure on the right shows that we all possess roots that reach deep into the earth. (See the half circle or spiral underneath the blue figure.) We possess tools that enable us to reach for the stars. (See the crutch or pincers that elongate the right hand of the figure.) We are always on an evolutionary journey. We constantly learn to handle more and more complex tasks and to deal with more diverse energies. The seven wands represent a ladder with seven rungs: the Jacob''s ladder, which bridges the gap between heaven and earth, between our wishes and reality.

Dali''s version of this card shows a scene from »The Oath of the Horatians« by Jacques-Louis David. The horatians were the personal guards of the Roman emperors. Oath and treason, ideals and idols become an important issue whenever we are faced with strong energies that we have to learn to deal with. Dali rightfully puts the power of enthusiasm in the centre of his picture. The book in front of the two wands emphasises the moving power of the human spirit and of the written word. Great undertakings require motivation and enthusiasm. The right word at the right time can do miracles and heal many wounds. But false ideals can also make the blood boil. They open up old wounds and create new ones by being overly zealous or by exercising blind obedience. The insect on the left side shows that this all happens on a subconscious, vegetative, or automatic level. The card counsels you to become aware of your own motivating forces and your goals and to take full responsibility for your own actions. You are challenged to grow in understanding and stature.

The ghastly face in the left upper corner represents a bad conscience or the always demanding super-ego. But the card might also be interpreted in a totally different way. Dali, who often made fun of the Catholic Church, shows in this picture the positive meaning of the Christian symbol of the cross. The burdened figure represents Jesus who carries the cross and the ten wands at the same time. To carry ten wands means to accept all available energies, all instincts, purposes, motives, and situations. To make a bundle of the ten wands means nothing less than to accept life unconditionally and in its totality. This is also the true meaning of the cross. The cross as a symbol is much older than Christianity. It is — like the circle or the square — a symbol, which distinguishes and integrates all forces. (For example: the four points of the compass.) That Jesus died on the cross is a different matter altogether. His life and his death did not end on the cross, they ended with his resurrection. The Christian maxim »Those who love Jesus should take up his cross and follow him« has the positive meaning of accepting life unconditionally and committing oneself wholeheartedly. Dali shows this absolute devotion to life in a remarkable manner. The butterflies symbolise the transformational power of this attitude. Viewed this way the face represents a clear conscience and the vision of a meaningful purpose in life. Practical advice: Throw off your old burdens. Recognise what is going on.

The Queen of Cups is really a queen of shells with a sharp tongue. Her crown reminds us of the dome of St. Peters in Rome. In this card Dali has used elements of two famous paintings. The central figure was taken from the painting of Elisabeth of Austria by Francois Clouet and her thin moustache was inspired by Marcel Duchamp''s well-known persiflage of the Mona Lisa. With his unique composition Dali has established a crucial breakthrough in interpreting this card. Many — even modern — interpretations accept only part of the Queen of Cups'' realm. They only see the »good mother« or her opposite, the vampire and »bad mother.« What is often missing is the insight that the emotional needs represented by cups are the source of all action and that emotional maturity enables a person to use his or her powers in a constructive way. Our emotional aliveness is a source of strength. Our emotions show us what is important to us. And emotions are always ambiguous because emotional maturity consists in learning to distinguish and being able to understand genuine feelings and destructive impulses.

On the one hand it is a positive symbol of transformation (like the alchemistical crucible) and of growing life (like the womb). On the other hand it is a negative symbol reminding us of Dr. Frankenstein and other scary scientific experiments. The glass vessel also stands for an invisible wall and shield symbolising a negative spell or a curse. If this king doesn''t want to become a prisoner of his own needs and emotions, he will have to learn to successfully deal with the highest emotional heights as well as the lowest emotional depths. This is symbolised by the lily sceptre (see The Empress and The Emperor) and the wand in his right hand with a fist or devil''s head at the end. This card stands for a person with focused energy who is not afraid of any taboos (devils) and who walks his path with a clear conscience and free of sin (lily). »Living is desiring.« Instincts and presentiments, temptations and needs have to be dealt with. The fulfilment of your dominant desires and the dissolution of basic fears will lead to personal growth and to the end of all desiring — resulting in the blessed state of perfect contentment. It is through change that we grow and the more we grow the better we can deal with change. But only if we don''t neglect our true nature and our personal dignity. Practical advice: Be true to your desires. If you walk through a dark tunnel, take a light with you. Do not be afraid of confronting taboos and the dark side. But do not become too fascinated by it.

The suit of cups is all about fullness as well as emptiness, good as well as bad emotions, exalting as well as pompous (arrogant) movements of your psyche. Another contradiction of this card is the contrast between the wide-open sea and the contents of the single cup. You experience your connectedness with all and everything through your oceanic feelings. The single cup on the other hand stands for your individual inner life. You — just like everybody else — possess a soul and a name, which expresses your connectedness with all beings as well as your individuality. If you can manage to harmonise your individuality with the great flow of life, you will experience a very special baptism and drink deep from the fountain of youth. There simply is no better »anti-ageing« method. The secret of the inner fountain of youth consists of your lively participation in the stream of life whilst retaining your awareness and independence as an individual. Do not drown in your feelings. Do not refuse your emotions. The more you experience your feelings, the happier and more content you will be. The saying »Only the one who is not afraid to face death will truly live« does not just apply to physical death. It applies to your daily »dying« and rebirth as well. Practical advice: Become clear about your genuine needs. Develop trust in yourself, in God, and in the world. Cherish your feelings and develop and cultivate all the things that truly matter to you.'

SET meaning_upright = 'Your emotional range. This card shows a scene from the 1817 painting of Cupid and Psyche by Francois-Edouard Picot. Greek mythology tells us of how the human Psyche and the divine Cupid long for each other and how after much ado they are finally united. The Roman poet Apuleius used this ancient myth as a model for his story of a man turned into a golden donkey. That love can indeed give wings to the lovers is symbolised by the yellow staff of Hermes (two intertwined serpents) and the winged lion''s head. Staff of Hermes and winged lion were inspired by the Waite Tarot. On the one hand they represent the happy joining, on the other the fatal entanglement of two people in love. On the abdomen of the lying-down Psyche we recognise a big wide-open eye. This is part of a face, which has been drawn around the scene. On the left we see the lips and the hairy chin of this head, which is reminiscent of a well-known portrait by Rembrandt. The unkempt hair on the chin and on the back of the head reminds us also of certain figures from the story of the golden donkey. All in all this is a very ambiguous and complex picture. The two cups represent the polarity of our emotional life with sympathy and antipathy, affection and repulsion. Each of us has to learn to deal with the »two souls in our chests.« As long as emotional matters are divided or scattered, you will not know who you are and what it is that you want. The clearing of ambiguous feelings will lead to an emotional maturing. A grown-up person is defined by the successful clearing of emotional ambiguity. Practical advice: The validity of your feelings must not depend on the approval or disapproval of others. Avoid bad compromises in emotional and intimate matters. It is of utmost importance that you learn to deal purposefully with your emotional needs.'

Life will become a feast if you go beyond yourself and learn to retain your emotional independence even in the company of others. This card is all about the quality of your feelings. The nudity of the figures represents beauty and naturalness. Symbolically it encourages honesty and at the same time warns of insolence (shamelessness and lack of culture). The red forms in the upper corners can be interpreted as a curtain, but remind us also of the jellyfish seen in the Six of Cups or of the phantom figures in other cards. On the left and right sides two springs gush forth representing the inconsistencies of your emotional life. Overall this is a lucky and auspicious card, if you interpret it as a symbol of emotional intelligence. Conscious emotions are fruitful emotions. The magic of feeling needs to be enhanced by the magic of thoughts, words, and deeds to make up your personal emotional dance. Surrender to your feelings to become one in body, mind, and spirit. This inner unity constitutes the basis for happy and lasting relationships. Practical advice: Develop your emotional vocabulary. Learn to understand the feelings of others. Express your own feelings vividly. Approach others or define your own boundaries — even if you are not used to it. The right word at the right time can make miracles come true.'

On the other it challenges you to stop your brooding, to find a new direction in life, and to reach for the stars (like the tree). Expect new emotional experiences (note the hand!). The cup above the tree reminds us of the Ace of Cups. The ups and downs, joys and sorrows associated with the ace are present in this card too. This is all about finding the right balance between your own feelings and those of others. You might have to accept this new cup, regardless of whether it contains sweet wine or bitter medicine. Or you might refuse to accept this cup; saying »Let this cup pass me by.« Quite often it is the refusal, the saying of the simple word »no« that has been missing from your life. The bird in the tree warns you of your own eccentricities and flights of fancy. At the same time it heralds the coming of new enthusiasm and new meanings. The shadowy figure on the left, uniting a bird''s head with a female body, represents your emotional reserves. But beware: Ancient Greek myths describe the sirens this way. They were soul catchers and bewitchers. Ulysses escaped from the power of their seductive song only by tying himself to the mast and by sealing the ears of his comrades with wax.

Here and now you are confronted with desires and fears of times long past and of times still to come. The two cups still standing suggest that you can always choose which emotions and needs to accept and which not. The naked figure in the centre represents truth and openness.

New inner realities and new experiences lie ahead. What aspect of the card attracts you most? Reconciliation or separation, moving on or staying put are all equally valid possibilities. The path in the centre of the card moves past a castle (security or imprisonment) to the ocean and the wide-open sky.

This is of course easier said than done. The card shows the outline of a jellyfish indicating how difficult it is to grasp the true influence of early conditioning. Although experiences from childhood and early adolescence fill every cell of your being, they are very often hard to grasp and even harder to understand, because they are »only« internal processes. The bird has a double meaning. It warns you to be aware of your eccentricities and pipe dreams and at the same time encourages you to be true to your personal ideals and higher perspectives. In order to differentiate between a pipe dream and an ideal you have to deal with your childhood days (and with the children in your life). Carefully evaluate your emotional experience. What was good and what wasn''t? How can you recreate the beauty of yesterday and how can you prevent past hurts from resurfacing? What can you do to help yourself if old threats or old negative feelings should reoccur? Today you have more alternatives and many more possibilities. Sort out your feelings. Seize the chance to let go of old fears and to fulfil your true desire. This will rejuvenate and empower you. Practical advice: Dig up your memories until you can bury old feuds.

The central figure is surrounded by the outline of a big head. Maybe it''s all in your head? Is reality only a figment of your imagination? Is your life lived symbolically? The contents of the seven cups is fashioned after the Waite-Tarot and is drawn rather sketchily emphasising its symbolic character. The seven cups represent the promising yet deterrent character of gifts and presents. The head symbolises not only beauty but also vanity. The tower like castle represents might and greatness, but also arrogance and loneliness. Pearls and precious gems speak for themselves. The next cup contains a laurel wreath symbolising success or futility. Is it a funeral wreath or a winner''s wreath? The dragon stands for the forces of the underworld, which could devour you or bring you luck. The serpent symbolises not only wisdom but also falseness and your base instincts. The seventh cup is empty, hinting at new possibilities or chances missed. This card challenges you to deeply explore your needs and personal goals. Sometimes your greatest longing and most unrealistic yearning turns out to be the most appropriate desire.

This is the card of great desires and passions coming true, but also of false romanticism and intoxication. How can you have the one and avoid the other? Ten cups in a rainbow signify a well-rounded sense of security and the safety that comes from trusting. In a negative sense it signifies a defensive force field, a magnetic shield, or a glass ceiling, which are all hard to penetrate. Any hermetic ideas about life, love, or faith function at best as a sort of hothouse. They provide shelter and warmth, but they keep real life out. They create a force field, but cannot fulfil the essential needs of the individual (symbolised by the missing lower body parts of the figures). The two central figures have been taken from a painting by Giuseppe Maria Crespi and the three peaches from the 1638 painting »The Five Senses« by Jacques Linard. A very wise combination indeed, because all forms of false and harmful passions dull the senses whereas joyful and wholesome passions uplift the senses. It is this sensitivity and this fruitfulness of sense and sensuality that determines our happiness in high times of great emotion. Practical advice: Don''t be afraid of oceanic feelings. This is a perfect opportunity to take a fearless look at powerful and bold passions. The more you learn to identify if you can truly trust yourself and others, the more secure you will feel.

Use the weapons of your mind to liberate yourself from internal and external dependencies. Stand up for yourself. Do not be impressed by superficialities or delusions.

In a more positive sense it indicates that the realm of the mind is a world in itself with special chances and opportunities. Use the capacity of your mind to recognise and to define vague desires or fears. One of the major strengths of this mistress of perception lies in the release of unfounded fears. Most prejudices and fears are unfounded and therefore constitute self-imposed obstacles, masks, or convenient excuses. In other cases they express authentic needs and experiences, which cannot be expressed in any other way. Swords (the weapons of the mind) have the power to develop and refine your mental capacities. To define and discern experiences, which you have been unaware of previously, is part of that power. Practical advice: Ensure clarity in your decisions and your behaviour.

But this is nevertheless a very wise depiction. Living a symbolic life is one of the great dangers of the suit of swords. (And when acknowledged, a great task.) If you totally live within and for the realm of the mind, you will be completely absorbed in your imagination, your ideas, and your perception. You might think the title of a doctor or a professor, an award, a medal, or an Oscar will bring you the greatest happiness. To gather such trophies might become your most important goal in life. But because these trophies are nothing but symbols, your life turns into a symbolic life. You do not live in the real world anymore. You sacrifice your humanity and your interpersonal relationships for the gathering of trophies. This will lead to a shrivelling up of your personality, which then can be shown around on a silver platter. This is a negative consequence of extreme occupation with the mind. Positive alternatives may differ, but they always have to do with overcoming the dangers of symbolically living and using the power of your mind to deal with real problems and to experience real happiness. In a positive sense the pomp and the adornments of the horseman represent a colourful, rich, and liberated life — including a clear conscience (see the white colour of the hat and the horse) and lots of love.

The sword is used to make deep cuts and to draw the line, separating that which belongs from that which does not belong. On this picture a bare hand holds the sword blade.

To develop the former and avoid the latter, we eventually will have to learn to fly. The fruitfulness of the mind is measured by the refinement and fulfilment of your practical needs.

Jean-Paul Marat was one of the great radicals of the French revolution, whose life came to a violent end. Dali used this particular scene to warn us of the dangers of the hypnotic effect of ideas and of fanaticism in general, which turns people into martyrs or criminals motivated by political or religious beliefs. The serpent on the right side is an ambiguous symbol. On the one hand it warns you to beware of your lower drives and animal instincts, on the other it is a symbol of wisdom. In general four swords represent the completeness of the weapons of the mind. Thoughts and ideas have formed a whole. Ideally your thoughts should be »well-rounded«, they should complement and inspire each other. This is a sign of wisdom and expanded consciousness. In less than ideal circumstances completeness of thinking expresses itself in disastrous convictions that can only lead to dire consequences. Then you will become a victim or a perpetrator, a fundamentalist or a martyr. This constitutes not just a very real danger for your survival — as we saw in the case of Jean-Paul Marat. When your convictions become more important than love or life, you will have turned into one of the living dead. Because you were hurt yourself, you want to hurt others.

Ferrying someone from one shore to the other can be likened to translating words from one language into another. Different people and their respective truths are like two shores or two different worlds, which need to be connected. The ferryman depicted on the card confronts us with an archetype representing the controlling power and transformational abilities of the human mind. In many traditional stories the ferryman is depicted as being incomplete and unredeemed. In the fairy tale of the devil with the three golden hairs, the ferryman is cursed to ferry back and forth for eternity. In his novel Siddhartha Hermann Hesse created a very different version of the ferryman that millions of people have learned to love. Hesse''s ferryman is a symbol of enlightenment representing human consciousness as a bridge between two worlds. Whether or not you will get ahead in your current situation depends entirely on your mental clarity and openness. Useless thoughts are like old luggage that you carry with you to each new destination. Useful thoughts on the other hand pertain to the real reason behind any issue in the same way the ferryman will only get ahead if his pole makes contact with the bottom of the river. Practical advice: Be thorough in all your dealings. Use your mental flexibility and the intensity of the moment to find out which needs really motivate you and others. Communicate what you need.'

The blood red, sketchily drawn creature on the left represents the second self, the inner being, and a special energy, which is — already or still — separate from you. Each human being brings a new truth into this world. As long as you are separated from your truth, you will be searching for all eternity. You are faced with contradictions and questions that have one purpose only: to enable you to find the answer that is in true harmony with your personality. This card stands for cunning, scheming, and other unpleasant qualities only, if you do not know yourself or others, if your outer personality and inner being are permanently separated. You are searching, but you don''t know what you are looking for. You are moving, but you don''t know where you are headed. However there is an alternative. You will broaden your mind if you look at familiar things from a different perspective. Often this happens very naturally after returning from a vacation and seeing your familiar surroundings in a different light. And it often happens spontaneously when you are in love, when you are hurt, angry or relieved. Then you see the world through new eyes. The card challenges you to do this deliberately. If you draw this card, you are encouraged to bury old feuds and to ban the ghosts of yesterday from your life for good. Practical advice: Reevaluate all that you take for granted. Take a break — for an hour or a whole day. Allow yourself to do something »foolish.« See to your needs so that they may benefit yourself and others in the long term. Say your good-byes to aims and ambitions, which no longer serve you. Pay attention to your dreams and your life''s wishes.'

All conscious thinking and knowing has a spiritual dimension that helps us to realise our own limitations and the existence of a reality that is much greater than we are. Our children — in a physical or figurative sense as new truths or issues — can go beyond our own limitations. The picture might show a child. It cannot be clearly seen whether the woman holds a child in her arms because she is hidden by a butterfly. Beyond the boundaries of the ego lies eternal life, which is symbolised by the heavenly city above the figure. Eternity is but another term for the deliberate living of your uniqueness. This card is about a farewell to castles in the sky and childish inhibitions. Free yourself from all dependencies. The city or castle in the background symbolises parental influences. Parents might influence you even from afar. Come in contact with your own source, with your own inner child, and with all that you want to contribute to the world. In many situations this card should encourage you to withdraw for a while. Retreat or hide in your cocoon like a caterpillar in order to get in touch with yourself and to discover new and original thoughts. Become the master of your life and the centre of your world. Always remain in harmony with yourself. You will experience a great relaxation if your thinking, doing, and wishing exists in harmony with your long-term interests.

A person doing things his or her own way enters dimensions of being that are uncharted, because no one has been there before. Once we redefine our own individuality and comprehend the uniqueness of each life, our horizon will change completely. Nightmares and nagging doubts are part of this process. Do not be afraid. Take your time to digest the new situation. Accept doubts and disappointments, but do not succumb to despair. Accept your responsibility. There are new possibilities and new horizons ahead. Go forth and explore them. The time has come to think about your thinking. Reevaluate your ideas from a higher perspective. Try to comprehend what your thoughts really mean. Beware of irrational actions and automatic reactions. Do not let yourself be provoked. It is no mere coincidence that the structure and colour of this card remind us of the Stars and Stripes, the flag of the United States of America. The land of unlimited opportunity always had to deal with ghosts and spirits in a special way. This is a unique aspect of the Dali Tarot. Practical advice: Accept your responsibility.

In a negative sense, swords as weapons of the mind represent the destructive power of the mind — man''s alienation from nature. The destructive and hurtful aspect of the swords culminates in the perfidious attempt on Caesar''s life. Aside from portraying an actual event during the Ides of March when Caesar fell by the sword, the card has a more symbolic meaning. It warns us to beware of highly developed and cultivated people who nevertheless succumb to their lower instincts and malice. In a positive sense the card has a totally different meaning. It is about reaping the fruits of the mind. Ten swords represent a fullness of consciousness and knowledge. In keeping with many other Tarot decks this card also does not depict a wise man, a philosopher-king, or a guru on a throne as symbol for the highest knowledge and insight. On the contrary: The Ten of Swords represents the end of all role models and idols. The old Zen-saying »If you meet Buddha on the road, kill Buddha« exemplifies the meaning of this card. This famous Koan, one of the illogical riddles of the Zen-Buddhists, does not intend to instigate murder and mayhem; it calls upon all of us to let go of all role models and idols. The Buddha you meet on the road (meaning, the one you believe to comprehend) is not the Buddha. The German word »Kaiser« (emperor) is derived from the Latin name Caesar. Do not accept any emperors in your life. Do not accept any authority besides God''s and your own. Practical advice: Strengthen your mental alertness.

On the one hand the »demon« in the upper right corner symbolises an excess of scruples, on the other a missing or bad conscience, which constantly »pulls your hair.« Do not foolishly play around with the special talents or handicaps that you possess. You are faced with unique chances as well as difficulties. They are part of what makes you unique. Understand the value of your life''s experiences.

Their form reminds us of the arches shown on the card The Magician. They emphasise your uniqueness as an individual. At the same time the cascading flowers represent gentleness and tenderness, but also fragility. You are called upon to respect the experiences of each individual. It is the great art of this queen to absorb the experiences of many people and to create something extraordinary and of lasting value from it. Practical advice: For your current situation this card means that you do possess the strength to pursue happiness and to make your fortune.

That Dali immortalised himself on this card can be interpreted in two different ways. If Dali intended to offer himself as an investment, as an authority, and a special case you will look at the picture, adore his genius and feel how small and insignificant you really are. But maybe Dali intended to portray himself as an example for each of us. Then you would look at the card and understand that each one of us is called upon to be his or her own master in terms of wealth and wellbeing. The many fingerprints on this card are supposed to show you that you need to become active yourself and create your own fortune. The ocelot (with a blurred face on a leash in the lower left corner) warns you of predatory instincts and the lust for money and purely sexual appeal. But at the same time it challenges you to fearlessly face the animal and the predator in yourself and your fellow human beings. The relaxed, half-sleeping pose of Dali together with the resting bull above his head warns you of carelessness and complacency. In a positive sense it encourages you to relax and to feel comfortable with yourself. You are your own greatest resource — your field and your harvest, vineyard and wine. Create a life and work style that fits your personality. Create your own personal culture. Become the architect, artist, and builder of your life. Practical advice: Reevaluate your financial situation as well as your talents and your desire for a productive and fulfilled life. Make a survey of what you have accomplished so far and what is still missing from your life. Care for that which you have planted — in your garden as well as in your life in general.

But you should pay attention to the fact that this card is the only one of the coins suit that does not show a coin. We see only six larger red spots on a shining white area in the sky. This could be interpreted negatively: Your talent falls to pieces because there is no connecting circle or framework. The whole dissolves into its parts because you focus too much on the details. In a positive sense the same symbol could be interpreted as an explosion. If you truly have become yourself and found your place in the world and with God, no borders will be able to contain or limit you. It is the small things, the seemingly insignificant, that take on a special meaning. By exploring your current contradictions you will gain experience and develop a deep sense of tranquillity. Do not be afraid of conflicts, on the contrary, look for conflicts. Strengthen your faith in your ability to solve problems, to release fears, and to fulfil your desires. Practical advice: Forgive yourself and others for not being perfect. Even the »rubbish« that you produce can still be used as manure and humus. You cannot change your fellow human beings, but you can accept them as they are — with their special talents. See to it that their talents can be used most effectively.

You have to sieve through the familiar in order to discover the special — just like picking up money that has been lying on the street unnoticed. The big transparent dragonfly on the bottom of the picture symbolises that your own talents often seem insignificant. You do not take yourself seriously enough or you have the wrong idea about what talent really is. You might think that only specialists or famous entertainers possess a special talent. In reality every person has special talents because he or she embodies special experiences and abilities. You »only« have to learn to understand the value of your unique experiences and abilities. That the process of becoming a child again often drags the ghosts of yesterday from their graves is symbolised by the blue figure on the right of the card. Do not allow yourself to be irritated by it, keep on searching, and evaluate your experiences and results. You will find the right answer to your current questions by examining your value system. What has lost its importance? What has become newly important? Use your current questions to redefine how important certain results really are.

The pentagram (the five-pointed star also known as pentacle) is an energy sign and a symbol for man. The five points represent head, hands, and feet. The card emphasises the double nature of man. You are like a coin with the two sides representing your character. On the one side experience and expectation, on the other future events and results. The one side reads, »How have I been shaped?« The other, »What do I give shape to?« Every human being has certain extraordinary and certain quite ordinary aspects.

Your focus in life will change. Old principles will become ambiguous, formerly important habits suddenly seem questionable, and new purposes are added to old ones. You are in the midst of it all and experience yourself like never before. This is your opportunity to liberate yourself and to let go of what formerly seemed to be practical necessities. You are called upon to see beyond your narrow view of life and to break free from your limited reality. This is symbolised by the red figures outside of the central frame. You are encouraged to change, to expand your »frame of life.« But the card also warns you not to take yourself too seriously and to puff yourself up or to become the victim of empty promises. You are neither the servant nor the master of circumstance. An »all or nothing« attitude will not help you. Do not play with destiny but do not fight against it either. You have chosen in the past and you are free to choose again and to put your life into a new context. When your focus in life changes, you will experience unexpected confirmations, but also much insecurity. This is a blessing for the development of your personality — despite all the difficulties involved.

For the devout Christian the picture of Christ represents a calling to follow in his footsteps (imitatio dei), to heed the call of God, and to realise his or her own personal calling. The calling has always been the traditional meaning of this card. Although Dali''s picture is unique in its arrangement, it conveys the same message as many other versions of this card. The city or castle in the tree represents your personal aims, which are above and behind all your efforts. Do these objectives resemble a dream house or are they more like the proverbial castle in the sky? All your ideals and aims are being questioned now. You will not be able to achieve any peak performances if you do not call upon all your latent talents. The circles on the robe of Christ or the saintly figure may be interpreted as a labyrinth. It might hint at the great effort and all the searching involved before you will reach your peak. If you look at the labyrinth from a different angle, it looks like the shell of a great tortoise. On the one hand this symbol encourages you to be consistent and patient, on the other it warns you to beware of reclusive and standoffish behaviour. Only peak performances that enhance your personal well-being and expand your consciousness are of any lasting value. Each person has his or her own peak to climb. Naturally there are mountains of varying heights. But every mountain has a peak. The question is whether or not you will reach your peak.

Do not waste your time with show-offs or yes-men. Every human being possesses something unique that is his and his alone. Neither good nor bad behaviour will help you to succeed.

On the right side the figures are hidden by big flowers, which symbolise the blossoming of each individual''s magic and the sheltering of private life. Five coins represent the essence of the earth element: the full blossoming of your talents. This blossoming is emphasised by the caterpillar in its cocoon (directly above the lower four coins) and the butterflies. It takes both community and individuality to achieve things. Personal assets (property as well as ability) create true wealth only if they contribute towards ruling out avoidable human hardships and making unavoidable hardships bearable. There are hardships caused by hunger or sickness, but also others, which arise from unfulfilled needs: the hunger for meaning, the thirst for love, or the longing for roots. Each and every type of human plight is a tragedy. Where the need is greatest, your talents can achieve the most. »That which cannot be avoided needs to be emphasised.« Make a virtue of necessity. Where the darkness is deepest, your light is needed most. Where your talents shine, walls become transparent and you will stand on firm ground. Take care of your strengths as well as your weaknesses.

Do not waste your time giving alms or appealing to someone''s charity. Much more is needed here. The right figure has a halo around his head. (See also Three of Coins, Four of Coins, or Ten of Wands.) Again Dali can be credited with emphasising the divine dimension. Whenever giving and taking become one, whenever strengths and weaknesses are reconciled, a divine blessing can be felt. This blessing is represented by the sketchily drawn figure with the raised arms in the background. Inside the figure we see a red chalice or a glass with red wine and a tablet with eight rolls of dough. This symbolises the Christian concept of transmutation: Bread and wine provide physical as well as spiritual nourishment. Whenever you use your talents to satisfy your needs and use your needs to stimulate your talents, you gain something. Both aspects will benefit by the result — a true win-win-situation. In this manner you can transform plain necessities into a blessed creation. Practical advice: New ways of realising your own needs and of understanding the needs of others are called for. Learn to distinguish productive from unproductive needs. The value of that which you own is greatest, when as many people as possible benefit from it.

Objective facts and subjective questions are on the one hand related, but on the other different. There are objective matters that you will only be able to solve by realising your own destiny, your own purpose in life. Each matter solved will prove to you that you are indeed on the right track.

SET meaning_upright = 'The Zero as role model. Zero (or the missing number) is nothing. It warns you of a life whose motto would be: »all loss and no gain.« The zero point defines your personal starting point, your place of unity with yourself, and the very core of your being. Like the initial point of a coordinate system this card represents the beginning as well as the end of all that makes up an individual. To look into the future with courage (even or just because it cannot be foreseen) means charting your own course, which is especially necessary when all role models have failed you and you are forced to act without any backing. The more unusual your path, the more panic you will experience. Pan in Greek means »all.« Therefore panic is all-at-once. The more room you give the Fool in your life, the easier it will be to get used to accepting yourself, God, and the world as they are. (See the praying saint in the picture.) Everything you know has a special importance in your life — at the right time. Look at the shadowy figure by the wayside. It could represent your second self that you are desperately missing and longing for. Do not take it lightly if you are getting the feeling of missing out on something. It is your daily task to fulfil your most important desires and to let go of deep-seated fears. The Fool represents a state of being, in which you are perfectly happy. Practical advice: As a fool you are open to experiment and free to learn from all experiences. You are free not to know the answer or to change your point of view at will. Trust your own originality and trust the world. Do not let others drive you crazy. It is foolish to concern yourself with things or events that cannot be appropriately judged at the moment.'
